dependecies are a priority because it may give problems
in the future if not taken care of carefully.

>> go mod init (creates new module)
>> go list -m (prints all module's dependecies)
>> go get <library to get>
>> go mod tidy (removes unused references)
>> go test (to test all existing go files with testing code)
