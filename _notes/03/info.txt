important:
- operate at the edge of not knowing
- learn which battles to fight or let go


go workspace:

folder (need to exist)
  /bin (binaries)
  /pkg (archived files, already compiled files)
  /src (source code)
    /github.com
      /username
        /folder with code for project or repo

change environment variable

- GOPATH pointing to your workspace (restart vscode after the change)
         this is where you will write your source code
         (E:\golang-workspace)

- GOBIN  output folder when you use >>go install
         (E:\golang-workspace\bin)

to check system variables:
>>go env


retrieve package from git:
>>go get -d github.com/<user>/<package>
-> create your repository then use this command

format our source code (so that it is consistent across teams)
>>go fmt "...go"

generate native executable:
>> go build
