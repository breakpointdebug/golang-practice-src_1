:=   short declaration operator, declare variable and assign value
     (first time you use a variable, declare it)
     only works inside a function

=    only used after a variable has been declared but want to assign a new value

var  allow to declare variables outside function, package scope (can be used by other functions as long as it is within the package)


// globally declare there is a variable with identifier "z"
// and has a type of "int" and assigns value as 0 by default
// "zero value" is the default value if no assigned value by default
// boolean = false, string = "", int = 0

var z int

notes:
- it can only hold values of that declared type (golang is static)
- by declaring with a value it will automatically infer the type
- strings can use `` (backticks) and have "" (double quotes) used it inside
- primitive data types = the built in types
- composite data types = combination of primitive types (grouping)

fmt.Printf/fmt.Println ("%T", <variable>) = to check for type
