idiomatic way of writing go

compiler will just put the required code before compilation

there are certain patterns acceptable to be written


func main() as entry point

control flow:
1. sequence
2. loop; iterative
3. conditional


package = group similar code together

avoid unused variables (compiler will complain about code pollution)

... = variadic parameter = unlimited number of values of any type (interface{})

every value is of type empty interface (interface{})

throw away returns use: '_', if you don't want to use a return value and not assign it to any variable
